Migration to inmem db plus per run db
-------------------------------------

. Re-work the dbstruct data structure?
.. Move main.db to global?
.. [ run-id.db inmemdb last-mod last-read last-sync inuse ]
. Re-work all queries to use run-id to dereference server
. Open main.db directly in calls to -runtests etc. No need to talk remote?
