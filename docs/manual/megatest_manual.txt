Preface
=======
This book is organised as three sub-books; getting started, writing tests and reference.

Why Megatest?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Megatest project was started for two reasons, the first was an
immediate and pressing need for a generalized tool to manage a suite
of regression tests and the second was the fact that the author had
written or maintained several such tools at different companies over
the years and it seemed a good thing to have a single open source
tool, flexible enough to meet the needs of any team doing continuous
integrating and or running a complex suite of tests for release
qualification.

Megatest Design Philosophy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Megatest is intended to provide the minimum needed resources to make
writing a suite of tests and tasks for implementing continuous build
for software, design engineering or process control (via owlfs for
example) without being specialized for any specific problem
space. Megatest in of itself does not know what constitutes a PASS or
FAIL of a test. In most cases megatest is best used in conjunction
with logpro or a similar tool to parse, analyze and decide on the test
outcome.

Megatest Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All data to specify the tests and configure the system is stored in
plain text files. All system state is stored in an sqlite3
database. Tests are launched using the launching system available for
the distributed compute platform in use. A template script is provided
which can launch jobs on local and remote Linux hosts. Currently
megatest uses the network filesystem to call home to your master
sqlite3 database.
