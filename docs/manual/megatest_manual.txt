[dedication]
Dedication
==========

Dedicated to my wife, Joanna, who has, for many years now, supported
all my wacky ideas and nutty projects with only the occasional grumble
and roll of the eyes.

Thanks
------

To all the great people from the various places I've worked over the
years, thank you. I've benefitted from your patience and insight and I
hope that some of what I've learned from you has been incorporated
into Megatest.

Lastly, my thanks to all the wonderful open source creators. These
truly free projects, from Linux, xemacs, chicken scheme, and fossil to
asciidoc and bash are the philosophical and direct underpinnings of
the Megatest project.
