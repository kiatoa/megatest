Writing Tests
-------------

Creating a new Test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps will add a test "yourtestname" to your testsuite. This assumes
starting from a directory where you already have a megatest.config and
runconfigs.config.

. Create a directory tests/yourtestname
. Create a file tests/yourtestname/testconfig

.Contents of minimal testconfig
--------------------
[ezsteps]
stepname1 stepname.sh

# test_meta is a section for storing additional data on your test
[test_meta]
author myname
owner  myname
description An example test
reviewed never
--------------------

This test runs a single step called "stepname1" which runs a script
"stepname.sh". Note that although it is common to put the actions
needed for a test step into a script it is not necessary.
