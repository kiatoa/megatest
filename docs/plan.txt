Road Map
========

.	Quality improvements
..	Server stutters occasionally
..	Large number of items or tests still has some issues.
..	Code refactoring
..	Replace remote process with true API using json (supports Web app also)
.	Streamline the gui
..	Everything resizable
..	Less clutter
..	Tool tips
..	Filters on Run Summary, Summary and Run Control panel
..	Built in log viewer (partially implemented)
..	Refactor the test control panel
.	Help and documentation
..	Complete the user manual (Iâ€™ve been working on this lately).
..	Online help in the gui
.	Streamlined install
..	Deployed version (download a location independent ready to run binary bundle)
..	Install Makefile (in progress, needed for Mike to install on VMs)
..	Added option to compile IUP (needed for VMs)
.	Server side run launching
.	Support for re-running, cleaning etc. of individual steps (ezsteps makes this very easy to implement).
.	Launch process needs built in daemonizing (easy to do, just need to test it thoroughly).
.	Wizards for creating tests, regression areas (current ones are text only and limited).
.	Fully functional built in web service (currently you can browse runs but it is very simplistic).
.	Wildcards in runconfigs: e.g. [p1271/9/%/%]
.	Gui panels for editing megatest.config and runconfigs.config
.	Fully isolated tests (no use of NFS to see regression area files)
.	Windows version

Move test specific db to test dir
=================================

. Create teststats.db
. Redirect test run stats to teststats.db
. Redirect test steps data to teststats.db
. Redirect test_data to teststats.db
. Direct dboard to get stats from teststats.db
. Redirect kill requests to teststats.db
. Kill requests need to kill all processes in the tree
. Roll up overall stats to megatest.db every five minutes or when test done
. Add any necessary tests
