========

Note: This road-map is tentative and subject to change without notice.

~~~~

. Rerun step and or subsequent steps from gui
. Refresh test area files from gui
. Clean and re-run button
. Clean up STATE and STATUS handling.
.. Dashboard and Test control panel are reverse order - choose and fix
.. Move seldom used states and status to drop down selector
. Access test control panel when clicking on Run Summary tests
. Feature: -generate-index-tree
. Change specifing of state and status to use STATE1/STATUS1,STATE2/STATUS2

ww33
~~~~

. http api available for use with Perl, Ruby etc. scripts
. megatest.config setup entries for:
.. run launching (e.g. /bin/sh %CMD% > /dev/null)
.. browser "konqueror %FNAME%

ww34
~~~~

. Mark dependent tests for clean/rerun -rerun-downstream
. On run start check for defunct tests in RUNNING, LAUNCHED or REMOTEHOSTSTART and correct or notify
. Fix: refresh of gui sometimes fails on last item (race condition?)

ww35
~~~~

. refdb: Add export of csv, json and sexp
. Convert to using call-with-environment-variables where possible. Should allow handling of parallel runs in same process.
. Re-work text interface wizards. Several bugs on record. Possibly convert to gui based.
. Add to testconfig requirements section; launchlimiter scriptname, calls scriptname to check if ok to launch test
. Refactor Run Summary view, currently very clumsy
. Add option to show steps in Run Summary view

ww36
~~~~

. Refactor guis for resizeablity
. Add filters to Run Summary view and Run Control view
. Add to megatest.config or testconfig; rerunok STATE/STATUS,STATE/STATUS...
. Launch gates for diskspace; /path/one>1G,/path/two>200M,/tmp>5G

Bin List
~~~~~~~~

.	Quality improvements
..	Server stutters occasionally
..	Large number of items or tests still has some issues.
..	Code refactoring
..	Replace remote process with true API using json (supports Web app also)
.	Streamline the gui
..	Everything resizable
..	Less clutter
..	Tool tips
..	Filters on Run Summary, Summary and Run Control panel
..	Built in log viewer (partially implemented)
..	Refactor the test control panel
.	Help and documentation
..	Complete the user manual (Iâ€™ve been working on this lately).
..	Online help in the gui
.	Streamlined install
..	Deployed version (download a location independent ready to run binary bundle)
..	Install Makefile (in progress, needed for Mike to install on VMs)
..	Added option to compile IUP (needed for VMs)
.	Server side run launching
.	Support for re-running, cleaning etc. of individual steps (ezsteps makes this very easy to implement).
.	Launch process needs built in daemonizing (easy to do, just need to test it thoroughly).
.	Wizards for creating tests, regression areas (current ones are text only and limited).
.	Fully functional built in web service (currently you can browse runs but it is very simplistic).
.	Wildcards in runconfigs: e.g. [p1271/9/%/%]
.	Gui panels for editing megatest.config and runconfigs.config
.	Fully isolated tests (no use of NFS to see regression area files)
.	Windows version
